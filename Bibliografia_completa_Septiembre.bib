abstract = {Ostreococcus tauri is a unicellular green alga and amongst the smallest and simplest free-living eukaryotes. The O. tauri genome sequence was determined in 2006. Molecular, physiological and taxonomic data that has been generated since then highlight its potential as a simple model species for algae and plants. However, its proteome remains largely unexplored. This paper describes the global proteomic study of O. tauri, using mass spectrometry-based approaches: phosphopeptide enrichment, cellular fractionation, label-free quantification and 15N metabolic labeling. The O. tauri proteome was analyzed under the following conditions: sampling at different times during the circadian cycle, after 24h of illumination, after 24h of darkness and under various nitrogen source supply levels. Cell cycle related proteins such as dynamin and kinesin were significantly up-regulated during the daylight-to-darkness transition. This is reflected by their higher intensity at ZT13 and this transition phase coincides with the end of mitosis. Proteins involved in several metabolic mechanisms were found to be up-regulated under low nitrogen conditions, including carbon storage pathways, glycolysis, phosphate transport, and the synthesis of inorganic polyphosphates. Ostreococcus tauri responds to low nitrogen conditions by reducing its nitrogen assimilation machinery which suggests an atypical adaptation mechanism for coping with a nutrient-limited environment. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A method for DNA histogram analysis is described that depends only on the simple assumption that the data are normally distributed and a requirement that a G1 peak is present. A probability density function was derived from the assumption that extracted the S‐phase component from the whole histogram. The model was tested with simulated data, and good agreement between predicted and known proportions in G1, S, and G1+M was found. Good agreement was also found between duplicates of experimentally derived data. Some systematic errors are present in the analysis of certain types of histograms. However, these result in small errors when compared with biological and experimental variation and are less than the average of algorithms in current use. The program required only two queued requests, those of the start and the end channels over which the analysis is to be performed. The algorithms perform rapidly on a micro‐computer with only 28K addressable memory. Only two failures occurred in over 350 analyses and the method can be used for drug‐ and radiation‐perturbed populations as well as with unperturbed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1987 Alan R.

abstract = {Early in the history of life, algae changed the planet's atmosphere by producing oxygen, thus paving the way for the evolution of eukaryotic organisms. In an era in which the consumption of fossil fuels is a prime topic of concern, few people realize that the oil we currently exploit comes mostly from Cretaceous deposits of marine algae. Moving from ancient times to the present, the algae remain more important than most people realize. Today, the production of oxygen by algae (ca. 50% of all oxygen production) is another reason for saying "our lives depend on algae." Those who love seafood should thank the algae because algae are the primary producers upon which aquatic ecosystems depend. Thanks should come from all who are vegetarians or omnivores, because all land plants derive from a freshwater class of green algae and all land-animals-including the cows that provide the steaks for meat-lovers-depend directly or indirectly on land plants for food and often for shelter as well. As we use up the oil deposits provided by the ancient algae, we are turning to the modern algae for help. Given the photosynthetic abilities of the algae, they are one of the major focuses for sustainable biofuel production and CO2 consumption. Finally, the algae that give us the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the fuel for our cars (past and, perhaps, future), are also a source of active pharmaceutical compounds that can be used against drug-resistant bacterial strains, viruses (including Herpes Simplex and AIDS), and cancers. Roses are pretty and oak trees are impressive, but no other groups of "plants" have done so much, for so long, and, for so many as have the algae! {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Abstract Main conclusion It has been proposed that future efforts should focus on basic studies, biotechnology studies and synthetic biology studies related to algal biofuels and various high-value bioproducts for the economically viable production of algal biof uels. In recognition of diminishing fossil fuel reserves and the worsening environment, microalgal biofuel has been proposed as a renewable energy source with great potential. Algal biofuel thus became one of the hottest topics in renewable energy research in the new century, especially over the past decade. Between 2007 and 2017, research related to microalgal biofuels experienced a dramatic, three-stage development, rising, growing exponentially, and then declining rapidly due to overheating of the subject. However, biofuel-driven algal biotechnology and bioproducts research has been thriving since 2010. To clarify the gains (and pains) of the past decade and detail prospects for the future, this review summarizes the extensive scientific progress and substantial technical advances in algal biofuel over the past decade, covering basic biology, applied research, as well as the production of value-added natural products. Even after 10 years of hard work and billions of dollars in investments, its unacceptably high cost remains the ultimate bottleneck for the industrialization of algal biofuel. To maximize the total research benefits, both economically and socially, it has been proposed that future efforts should focus on basic studies to characterize oilgae, on biotechnology studies into various high-value bioproducts. Moreover, the development of synthetic biology provides new possibilities for the economically viable production of biofuels via the directional manufacture of microalgal bioproducts in algal cell factories.},

Although information on astaxanthin accumulation in H. pluvialis has substantially advanced in recent years, its underlying molecular bases remain elusive. An integrative metabolic and transcriptomic analysis has been performed for vegetative Haematococcus cells, grown both under N sufficiency (green palmelloid cells) and under moderate N limitation, allowing concurrent active cell growth and astaxanthin synthesis (reddish palmelloid cells). Transcriptional activation was noticeable in reddish cells of key enzymes participating in glycolysis, pentose phosphate cycle and pyruvate metabolism, determining the adequate provision of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate and pyruvate, precursors of carotenoids and fatty acids. Moreover, for the first time, transcriptional regulators potentially involved in controlling astaxanthin accumulation have been identified, a knowledge enabling optimization of commercial astaxanthin production by Haematococcus through systems metabolic engineering.},

abstract = {BackgroundLand plants (embryophytes) evolved from streptophyte green algae, a small group of freshwater algae ranging from scaly, unicellular flagellates (Mesostigma) to complex, filamentous thalli with branching, cell differentiation and apical growth (Charales). Streptophyte algae and embryophytes form the division Streptophyta, whereas the remaining green algae are classified as Chlorophyta. The Charales (stoneworts) are often considered to be sister to land plants, suggesting progressive evolution towards cellular complexity within streptophyte green algae. Many cellular (e.g. phragmoplast, plasmodesmata, hexameric cellulose synthase, structure of flagellated cells, oogamous sexual reproduction with zygote retention) and physiological characters (e.g. type of photorespiration, phytochrome system) originated within streptophyte algae.Recent ProgressPhylogenetic studies have demonstrated that Mesostigma (flagellate) and Chlorokybus (sarcinoid) form the earliest divergence within streptophytes, as sister to all other Streptophyta including embryophytes. The question whether Charales, Coleochaetales or Zygnematales are the sister to embryophytes is still (or, again) hotly debated. Projects to study genome evolution within streptophytes including protein families and polyadenylation signals have been initiated. In agreement with morphological and physiological features, many molecular traits believed to be specific for embryophytes have been shown to predate the Chlorophyta/Streptophyta split, or to have originated within streptophyte algae. Molecular phylogenies and the fossil record allow a detailed reconstruction of the early evolutionary events that led to the origin of true land plants, and shaped the current diversity and ecology of streptophyte green algae and their embryophyte descendants. Conclusions The Streptophyta/Chlorophyta divergence correlates with a remarkably conservative preference for freshwater/marine habitats, and the early freshwater adaptation of streptophyte algae was a major advantage for the earliest land plants, even before the origin of the embryo and the sporophyte generation. The complete genomes of a few key streptophyte algae taxa will be required for a better understanding of the colonization of terrestrial habitats by streptophytes.},

abstract = {Motivation: A fundamental interest in chronobiology is to compare patterns between groups of rhythmic data. However, many existing methods are ill-equipped to derive statements concerning the statistical significance of differences between rhythms that may be visually apparent. This is attributed to both the form of data used (longitudinal versus cross-sectional) and the limitations of the statistical tests used to draw conclusions. Results: To address this problem, we propose that a cosinusoidal curve with a particular parametrization be used to model and compare data of two sets of observations collected over a 24-h period. The novelty of our test is in the parametrization, which allows the explicit estimation of rhythmic parameters [mesor (the rhythm-adjusted mean level of a response variable around which a wave function oscillates), amplitude and phase], and simultaneously testing for statistical significance in all three parameters between two or more groups of datasets. A statistically significant difference between two groups, regarding each of these rhythmic parameters, is indicated by a P-value. The method is evaluated by applying the model to publicly available datasets, and is further exemplified by comparison to the currently recommended method, DODR. The results suggest that the method proposed may be highly sensitive to detect rhythmic differences between groups in phase, amplitude and mesor.},

abstract = {Background: Microalgae are emerging as promising sustainable sources for biofuels, biostimulants in agriculture, soil bioremediation, feed and human nutrients. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms underpinning microalgae physiology and the biosynthesis of compounds of biotechnological interest are largely uncharacterized. This hinders the development of microalgae full potential as cell-factories. The recent application of omics technologies into microalgae research aims at unraveling these systems. Nevertheless, the lack of specific tools for analysing omics raw data generated from microalgae to provide biological meaningful information are hampering the impact of these technologies. The purpose of ALGAEFUN with MARACAS consists in providing researchers in microalgae with an enabling tool that will allow them to exploit transcriptomic and cistromic high-throughput sequencing data. Results: ALGAEFUN with MARACAS consists of two different tools. First, MARACAS (MicroAlgae RnA-seq and Chip-seq AnalysiS) implements a fully automatic computational pipeline receiving as input RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) or ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) raw data from microalgae studies. MARACAS generates sets of differentially expressed genes or lists of genomic loci for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis respectively. Second, ALGAEFUN (microALGAE FUNctional enrichment tool) is a web-based application where gene sets generated from RNA-seq analysis as well as lists of genomic loci from ChIP-seq analysis can be used as input. On the one hand, it can be used to perform Gene Ontology and biological pathways enrichment analysis over gene sets. On the other hand, using the results of ChIP-seq data analysis, it identifies a set of potential target genes and analyses the distribution of the loci over gene features. Graphical representation of the results as well as tables with gene annotations are generated and can be downloaded for further analysis. Conclusions: ALGAEFUN with MARACAS provides an integrated environment for the microalgae research community that facilitates the process of obtaining relevant biological information from raw RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data. These applications are designed to assist researchers in the interpretation of gene lists and genomic loci based on functional enrichment analysis. ALGAEFUN with MARACAS is publicly available on https://greennetwork.us.es/AlgaeFUN/.},

abstract = {Although sex is now accepted as a ubiquitous and ancestral feature of eukaryotes, direct observation of sex is still lacking in most unicellular eukaryotic lineages. Evidence of sex is frequently indirect and inferred from the identification of genes involved in meiosis from whole genome data and/or the detection of recombination signatures from genetic diversity in natural populations. In haploid unicellular eukaryotes, sex-related chromosomes are named mating-type (MTs) chromosomes and generally carry large genomic regions where recombination is suppressed. These regions have been characterized in Fungi and Chlorophyta and determine gamete compatibility and fusion. Two candidate MT+ and MT- alleles, spanning 450-650 kb, have recently been described in Ostreococcus tauri, a marine phytoplanktonic alga from the Mamiellophyceae class, an early diverging branch in the green lineage. Here, we investigate the architecture and evolution of these candidate MT+ and MT- alleles. We analyzed the phylogenetic profile and GC content of MT gene families in eight different genomes whose divergence has been previously estimated at up to 640 Myr, and found evidence that the divergence of the two MT alleles predates speciation in the Ostreococcus genus. Phylogenetic profiles of MT trans-specific polymorphisms in gametologs disclosed candidate MTs in two additional species, and possibly a third. These Mamiellales MT candidates are likely to be the oldest mating-type loci described to date, which makes them fascinating models to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms of haploid sex determination in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Ostreococcus is a marine picophytoeukaryote for which culture studies indicate there are 'high-light' and 'low-light' adapted ecotypes. Representatives of these ecotypes fall within two to three 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clades for the former and one for the latter. However, clade distributions and relationships to this form of niche partitioning are unknown in nature. We developed two quantitative PCR primer-probe sets and enumerated the proposed ecotypes in the Pacific Ocean as well as the subtropical and tropical North Atlantic. Statistical differences in factors such as salinity, temperature and NO 3 indicated the ecophysiological parameters behind clade distributions are more complex than irradiance alone. Clade OII, containing the putatively low-light adapted strains, was detected at warm oligotrophic sites. In contrast, Clade OI, containing high-light adapted strains, was present in cooler mesotrophic and coastal waters. Maximal OI abundance (19 555±37 18S rDNA copies per ml) was detected in mesotrophic waters at 40 m depth, approaching the nutricline. OII was often more abundant at the deep chlorophyll maximum, when nutrient concentrations were significantly higher than at the surface (stratified euphotic zone waters). However, in mixed euphotic-zone water columns, relatively high numbers (for example, 891±107 18S rDNA copies per ml, Sargasso Sea, springtime) were detected at the surface. Both Clades OI and OII were found at multiple euphotic zone depths, but co-occurrence at the same geographical location appeared rare and was detected only in continental slope waters. In situ growth rate estimates using these primer-probes and better comprehension of physiology will enhance ecological understanding of Ostreococcus Clades OII and OI which appear to be oceanic and coastal clades, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost effective next generation sequencing technologies now enable the production of genomic datasets for many novel planktonic eukaryotes, representing an understudied reservoir of genetic diversity. O. tauri is the smallest free-living photosynthetic eukaryote known to date, a coccoid green alga that was first isolated in 1995 in a lagoon by the Mediterranean sea. Its simple features, ease of culture and the sequencing of its 13 Mb haploid nuclear genome have promoted this microalga as a new model organism for cell biology. Here, we investigated the quality of genome assemblies of Illumina GAIIx 75 bp paired-end reads from Ostreococcus tauri, thereby also improving the existing assembly and showing the genome to be stably maintained in culture.\n\nRESULTS: The 3 assemblers used, ABySS, CLCBio and Velvet, produced 95% complete genomes in 1402 to 2080 scaffolds with a very low rate of misassembly. Reciprocally, these assemblies improved the original genome assembly by filling in 930 gaps. Combined with additional analysis of raw reads and PCR sequencing effort, 1194 gaps have been solved in total adding up to 460 kb of sequence. Mapping of RNAseq Illumina data on this updated genome led to a twofold reduction in the proportion of multi-exon protein coding genes, representing 19% of the total 7699 protein coding genes. The comparison of the DNA extracted in 2001 and 2009 revealed the fixation of 8 single nucleotide substitutions and 2 deletions during the approximately 6000 generations in the lab. The deletions either knocked out or truncated two predicted transmembrane proteins, including a glutamate-receptor like gene.\n\nCONCLUSION: High coverage (>80 fold) paired-end Illumina sequencing enables a high quality 95% complete genome assembly of a compact $\sim$13 Mb haploid eukaryote. This genome sequence has remained stable for 6000 generations of lab culture.},

abstract = {The green lineage is reportedly 1,500 million years old, evolving shortly after the endosymbiosis event that gave rise to early photosynthetic eukaryotes. In this study, we unveil the complete genome sequence of an ancient member of this lineage, the unicellular green alga Ostreococcus tauri (Prasinophyceae). This cosmopolitan marine primary producer is the world's smallest free-living eukaryote known to date. Features likely reflecting optimization of environmentally relevant pathways, including resource acquisition, unusual photosynthesis apparatus, and genes potentially involved in C(4) photosynthesis, were observed, as was downsizing of many gene families. Overall, the 12.56-Mb nuclear genome has an extremely high gene density, in part because of extensive reduction of intergenic regions and other forms of compaction such as gene fusion. However, the genome is structurally complex. It exhibits previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity for a eukaryote. Two chromosomes differ structurally from the other eighteen. Both have a significantly biased G+C content, and, remarkably, they contain the majority of transposable elements. Many chromosome 2 genes also have unique codon usage and splicing, but phylogenetic analysis and composition do not support alien gene origin. In contrast, most chromosome 19 genes show no similarity to green lineage genes and a large number of them are specialized in cell surface processes. Taken together, the complete genome sequence, unusual features, and downsized gene families, make O. tauri an ideal model system for research on eukaryotic genome evolution, including chromosome specialization and green lineage ancestry.},

To address this problem, we analyzed the 2014 Ocean Sampling Day (OSD) metabarcoding dataset providing sequences from the V4 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene for 157 samples collected at 143 mostly coastal stations. Mamiellophyceae were found at nearly all OSD stations and represented 55% of the green microalgae (Chlorophyta) reads. We performed phylogenetic analyses of unique OSD metabarcodes (amplicon single variants, ASVs) and GenBank reference sequences from cultures and from the environment, focusing on the four most represented genera: Ostreococcus (45% of the Mamiellophyceae reads), Micromonas (34%), Bathycoccus (10%) and Mantoniella (8.7%). These analyses uncovered novel diversity within each genus except Bathycoccus. In Ostreococcus, a new clade (E) was the second most represented clade after Ostreococcus “lucimarinus”. Micromonas could be separated into nine clades, exceeding the six species and candidate species already described. Finally, we found two new environmental clades within Mantoniella. Each Mamiellophyceae clade had a specific distribution in the OSD dataset suggesting that they are adapted to different ecological niches.},

Previous studies based on single gene markers described their wide geographical distribution but led to discussion because of the uneven taxonomic resolution of the method. Here, we leverage genome sequences for six Mamiellales species, two from each genus Micromonas, Ostreococcus and Bathycoccus, to investigate their distribution across 133 stations sampled during the Tara Oceans expedition. Our study confirms the cosmopolitan distribution of Mamiellales and further suggests non-random distribution of species, with two triplets of co-occurring genomes associated with different temperatures: Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos and Micromonas pusilla were found in colder waters, whereas Ostreococcus spp. RCC809, Bathycoccus spp. TOSAG39-1 and Micromonas commoda were more abundant in warmer conditions. We also report the distribution of the two candidate mating-types of Ostreococcus for which the frequency of sexual reproduction was previously assumed to be very low. Indeed, both mating types were systematically detected together in agreement with either frequent sexual reproduction or the high prevalence of a diploid stage. Altogether, these analyses provide novel insights into Mamiellales' biogeography and raise novel testable hypotheses about their life cycle and ecology.},

abstract = {The green lineage (Viridiplantae) comprises the green algae and their descendants the land plants, and is one of the major groups of oxygenic photosynthetic eukaryotes. Current hypotheses posit the early divergence of two discrete clades from an ancestral green flagellate. One clade, the Chlorophyta, comprises the early diverging prasinophytes, which gave rise to the core chlorophytes. The other clade, the Streptophyta, includes the charophyte green algae from which the land plants evolved. Multi-marker and genome scale phylogenetic studies have greatly improved our understanding of broad-scale relationships of the green lineage, yet many questions persist, including the branching orders of the prasinophyte lineages, the relationships among core chlorophyte clades (Chlorodendrophyceae, Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae), and the relationships among the streptophytes. Current phylogenetic hypotheses provide an evolutionary framework for molecular evolutionary studies and comparative genomics. This review summarizes our current understanding of organelle genome evolution in the green algae, genomic insights into the ecology of oceanic picoplanktonic prasinophytes, molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of complexity in volvocine green algae, and the evolution of genetic codes and the translational apparatus in green seaweeds. Finally, we discuss molecular evolution in the streptophyte lineage, emphasizing the genetic facilitation of land plant origins. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {We assess population dynamics of picophytoplankton groups (≤2 $\mu$m diameter; Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and picoeukaryote) at a Pacific Ocean coastal site in the Southern California Bight. Weekly sampling (August 2000 to January 2002), dilution experiments, and flow cytometric analysis were combined with an instrument-specific calibration for cell size determination, allowing biovolume and carbon biomass estimation. Synechococcus was almost always numerically dominant, accounting for 60 ± 12% of the total picoplankton cells over time. It had moderately high growth rates (0.52-0.86 d-1) and was subject to low grazing mortality (-0.14 to -0.39 d-1). Prochlorococcus growth and mortality rates were roughly balanced (0.33 ± 0.14 d-1 and -0.36 ± 0.06 d-1, respectively). Picoeukaryotes had the highest growth rates (0.71-1.29 d-1) and were responsible for, on average, 76% of net carbon production (NCP), amounting in up to 32.05 ± 1.31 $\mu$g C L-1 d-1 produced and 28.31 ± 2.61 $\mu$g C L-1 d-1 consumed. In order to better define the eukaryotic component of these populations, an isolate was characterized via small subunit rRNA gene sequencing, transmission electron microscopy, and growth experiments and was identified as the prasinophyte Ostreococcus, not previously known to the Pacific Ocean. Our results show that although picoeukaryotes do not stand out as particularly important players in this system on the basis of cell abundance, they dominate in terms of picophytoplankton biomass and trophic transfer potential of carbon in this size class.},

Here we have sequenced and analysed the 2.4-megabase genome of Synechococcus sp. strain WH8102, revealing some of the ways that these organisms have adapted to their largely oligotrophic environment. WH8102 uses organic nitrogen and phosphorus sources and more sodium-dependent transporters than a model freshwater cyanobacterium. Furthermore, it seems to have adopted strategies for conserving limited iron stores by using nickel and cobalt in some enzymes, has reduced its regulatory machinery (consistent with the fact that the open ocean constitutes a far more constant and buffered environment than fresh water), and has evolved a unique type of swimming motility. The genome of WH8102 seems to have been greatly influenced by horizontal gene transfer, partially through phages. The genetic material contributed by horizontal gene transfer includes genes involved in the modification of the cell surface and in swimming motility. On the basis of its genome, WH8102 is more of a generalist than two related marine cyanobacteria.},

These cyanobacteria interact with a diverse microbial community that coexists with them. Comparative genomics of cultivated isolates has helped address questions regarding patterns of evolution and diversity among microbes, but the fraction that can be cultivated is miniscule compared to the diversity in the wild. To further probe the diversity of these groups and extend the utility of reference sequence databases, we report a data set of single cell genomes for 489 Prochlorococcus, 50 Synechococcus, 9 extracellular virus particles, and 190 additional microorganisms from a diverse range of bacterial, archaeal, and viral groups. Many of these uncultivated single cell genomes are derived from samples obtained on GEOTRACES cruises and at well-studied oceanographic stations, each with extensive suites of physical, chemical, and biological measurements. The genomic data reported here greatly increases the number of available Prochlorococcus genomes and will facilitate studies on evolutionary biology, microbial ecology, and biological oceanography.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by interacting with cis-elements in target gene promoters. Transcription regulators (TRs) assist in controlling gene expression through interaction with TFs, chromatin remodeling, or other mechanisms. Both types of proteins thus constitute master controllers of dynamic transcriptional networks. To uncover such control elements in the photosynthetic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we performed a comprehensive analysis of its genome sequence. In total, we identified 234 genes encoding 147 TFs and 87 TRs of ∼40 families. The set of putative TFs and TRs, including their transcript and protein sequences, domain architectures, and supporting information about putative orthologs, is available at http://plntfdb.bio.uni-potsdam.de/v2.0/. Twelve of 34 plant-specific TF families were found in at least one algal species, indicating their early evolutionary origin. Twenty-two plant-specific TF families and one plant-specific TR family were not observed in algae, suggesting their specific association with developmental or physiological processes characteristic to multicellular plants. We also analyzed the occurrence of proteins that constitute the light-regulated transcriptional network in angiosperms and found putative algal orthologs for most of them. Our analysis provides a solid ground for future experimental studies aiming at deciphering the transcriptional regulatory networks in green algae.

abstract = {Diatoms comprise a diverse and ecologically important group of eukaryotic phytoplankton that significantly contributes to marine primary production and global carbon cycling. Phaeodactylum tricornutum is commonly used as a model organism for studying diatom biology. Although its genome was sequenced in 2008, a high-quality genome annotation is still not available for this diatom. Here we report the development of an integrated proteogenomic pipeline and its application for improved annotation of P. tricornutum genome using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data. Our proteogenomic analysis unambiguously identified approximately 8300 genes and revealed 606 novel proteins, 506 revised genes, 94 splice variants, 58 single amino acid variants, and a holistic view of post-translational modifications in P. tricornutum. We experimentally confirmed a subset of novel events and obtained MS evidence for more than 200 micropeptides in P. tricornutum. These findings expand the genomic landscape of P. tricornutum and provide a rich resource for the study of diatom biology. The proteogenomic pipeline we developed in this study is applicable to any sequenced eukaryote and thus represents a significant contribution to the toolset for eukaryotic proteogenomic analysis. The pipeline and its source code are freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/gapeproteogenomic. We performed an integrated proteogenomic analysis of a model diatom and developed a pipeline that is applicable to any sequenced eukaryote.},

Comparison of the genome sequence with that of other algae and land plants demonstrate that K. flaccidum acquired many genes specific to land plants. We demonstrate that K. flaccidum indeed produces several plant hormones and homologues of some of the signalling intermediates required for hormone actions in higher plants. The K. flaccidum genome also encodes a primitive system to protect against the harmful effects of high-intensity light. The presence of these plant-related systems in K. flaccidum suggests that, during evolution, this alga acquired the fundamental machinery required for adaptation to terrestrial environments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We present highly contiguous and well-annotated genome assemblies for three unicellular C. reinhardtii relatives: Chlamydomonas incerta, Chlamydomonas schloesseri, and the more distantly related Edaphochlamys debaryana. The three Chlamydomonas genomes are highly syntenous with similar gene contents, although the 129.2 Mb C. incerta and 130.2 Mb C. schloesseri assemblies are more repeat-rich than the 111.1 Mb C. reinhardtii genome. We identify the major centromeric repeat in C. reinhardtii as a LINE transposable element homologous to Zepp (the centromeric repeat in Coccomyxa subellipsoidea) and infer that centromere locations and structure are likely conserved in C. incerta and C. schloesseri. We report extensive rearrangements, but limited gene turnover, between the minus mating type loci of these Chlamydomonas species. We produce an eight-species core-Reinhardtinia whole-genome alignment, which we use to identify several hundred false positive and missing genes in the C. reinhardtii annotation and 4260,000 evolutionarily conserved elements in the C. reinhardtii genome. In summary, these resources will enable comparative genomics analyses for C. reinhardtii, significantly extending the analytical toolkit for this emerging model system.},

Long-term seasonal blooms of this picoeukaryote were observed in association with stable plankton communities. On 5 June 2001, a distinctive monotypic picoplankton bloom was detected by flow cytometry as part of an ongoing study of "brown tide" (Aureococcus anophagefferens) bloom initiation in Long Island bays. The bloom reached a concentration of 5 × 105 cells{\textperiodcentered}mL-1 in West Neck Bay and lasted less than 2 weeks. Epifluorescence microscopy and TEM indicated that the bloom organism was an Ostreococcus-like picoalga, the first ever observed in a Long Island bay. Many cells of this alga contained numerous virus-like particles. The Ostreococcus-like picoalga, which resembles O. tauri, was rare in samples collected the following week. Instead, a substantial increase in the Synechococcus population was observed. Such rapid population changes have not previously been reported for Ostreococcus. Viral lysis and grazing by heterotrophic nanoflagellates may have contributed to the rapid decline of the Ostreococcus-like cells in West Neck Bay.},

abstract = {We studied the structure and seasonal dynamics of the photosynthetic picoeukaryote community at a coastal site off central Chile that is strongly affected by seasonal wind-driven upwelling. We determined the picoeukaryote phylogenetic diversity by cloning and sequencing the 18S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene amplified with Chloroplastida-biased primers. Chloroplastida made up 100% (autumn), 61% (spring), and 20% (summer) of the clone libraries. Most sequences belonged to Mamiellophyceae and clustered with Micromonas (clades A.BC.1, B.E.3, C.D.5), Ostreococcus (clade A), and Crustomastix (clade A). Fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with tyramide signal amplification (FISH-TSA) was used to determine the time variability in abundance of the total picoeukaryotic community, the Chloroplastida, and the genera Micromonas, Ostreococcus, and Bathycoccus over a period of 2 yr with nearly monthly sampling. The abundance of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes was low during the upwelling season (spring and summer) and high during the nonupwelling season (late fall and winter). Chloroplastida made up, on average, 74% of the total picoeukaryotic community, and the sum of the three genera probed accounted for 100% of the Chloroplastida abundances. Ostreococcus dominated the picophytoplanktonic community numerically throughout the year and, thus, appears to be a key component of the upwelling picoplanktonic community in the eastern South Pacific. {\textcopyright} 2011, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular volvocine alga having two mating types: mating type plus (mt+) and mating type minus (mt−), which are controlled by a single, complex mating-type locus. Sexual adhesion between the gametes is mediated by sex-specific agglutinin molecules on their flagellar membranes. Cell fusion is initiated by an adhesive interaction between the mt+ and mt− mating structures, followed by localized membrane fusion. The loci of sex-limited genes and the conformation of sex-determining regions have been rearranged during the evolution of volvocine algae; however, the essential function of the sex-determining genes of the isogamous unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is conserved in the multicellular oogamous Volvox carteri. The sexual reproduction of the unicellular charophycean alga, Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex, is also focused on here. The sexual reproductive processes of heterothallic strains are controlled by two multifunctional sex pheromones, PR-IP and PR-IP Inducer, which independently promote multiple steps in conjugation at the appropriate times through different induction mechanisms.

abstract = {The last decade, the biological and biomedical scientific landscape has seen the increase in use and applications of "omics" technologies. These technologies provide methods that allow for a comprehensive description of nearly all components within the cell. Microalgae not only play an important ecological role, but are also of commercial importance and therefore call for an in depth knowledge of basic biological functions. Knowledge of separate algal subsystems has gradually become available, but the challenge remains to integrate data obtained from these subsystems and from different levels of biological organization. Systems biology is a discipline that aims at this integration. In this paper, the current status of "omics" in algae is reviewed. At the lowest level, genome studies and the use of microarrays seem to have found widespread acceptance in algal research. At higher level such as the proteome and metabolome, however, very few omic studies have been carried out in algae so far. Moreover, the need arises for the construction of computer databases to store obtained information in a systematic way. To illustrate the use and especially the future needs of algal "omics" in a systems biological context, a case study is presented in which a freshwater alga was subjected to heavy metal stress and toxicity endpoints were monitored on different levels of biological organization. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Genome-level data allow identification of conserved proteins and protein families with extensive modifications, losses, or gains and expansion patterns that connect to niche specialization and diversification. Here, we contextualize attributes according to Viridiplantae evolutionary relationships, starting with orthologous protein families, and then focusing on key elements with marked differentiation, resulting in patchy distributions across green algae and plants. We place attention on peptidoglycan biosynthesis, important for plastid division and walls; phytochrome photosensors that are master regulators in plants; and carbohydrate-active enzymes, essential to all manner of carbohydratebiotransformations.

A systems approach thus is predicated on data integration. However, because of the complexity of biological systems and the specificities of the data-generating technologies (noisiness, heterogeneity, etc.), integrating omics data in an attempt to reconstruct signalling networks is not trivial. Developing its methodologies constitutes a major research challenge. Besides for their intrinsic value towards health care, environment and industry, prokaryotes are ideal model systems to further develop these methods because of their lower regulatory complexity compared with eukaryotes, and the ease with which they can be manipulated.

abstract = {Plants have shaped our human life form from the outset. With the emerging recognition of world population feeding, global climate change and limited energy resources with fossil fuels, the relevance of plant biology and biotechnology is becoming dramatically important. One key issue is to improve plant productivity and abiotic/biotic stress resistance in agriculture due to restricted land area and increasing environmental pressures. Another aspect is the development of CO 2-neutral plant resources for fiber/biomass and biofuels: a transition from first generation plants like sugar cane, maize and other important nutritional crops to second and third generation energy crops such as Miscanthus and trees for lignocellulose and algae for biomass and feed, hydrogen and lipid production. At the same time we have to conserve and protect natural diversity and species richness as a foundation of our life on earth. Here, biodiversity banks are discussed as a foundation of current and future plant breeding research. Consequently, it can be anticipated that plant biology and ecology will have more indispensable future roles in all socio-economic aspects of our life than ever before. We therefore need an in-depth understanding of the physiology of single plant species for practical applications as well as the translation of this knowledge into complex natural as well as anthropogenic ecosystems. Latest developments in biological and bioanalytical research will lead into a paradigm shift towards trying to understand organisms at a systems level and in their ecosystemic context: (i) shotgun and next-generation genome sequencing, gene reconstruction and annotation, (ii) genome-scale molecular analysis using OMICS technologies and (iii) computer-assisted analysis, modeling and interpretation of biological data. Systems biology combines these molecular data, genetic evolution, environmental cues and species interaction with the understanding, modeling and prediction of active biochemical networks up to whole species populations. This process relies on the development of new technologies for the analysis of molecular data, especially genomics, metabolomics and proteomics data. The ambitious aim of these non-targeted 'omic' technologies is to extend our understanding beyond the analysis of separated parts of the system, in contrast to traditional reductionistic hypothesis-driven approaches. The consequent integration of genotyping, pheno/morphotyping and the analysis of the molecular phenotype using metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics will reveal a novel understanding of plant metabolism and its interaction with the environment. The analysis of single model systems - plants, fungi, animals and bacteria - will finally emerge in the analysis of populations of plants and other organisms and their adaptation to the ecological niche. In parallel, this novel understanding of ecophysiology will translate into knowledge-based approaches in crop plant biotechnology and marker- or genome-assisted breeding approaches. In this review the foundations of green systems biology are described and applications in ecosystems research are presented. Knowledge exchange of ecosystems research and green biotechnology merging into green systems biology is anticipated based on the principles of natural variation, biodiversity and the genotype-phenotype environment relationship as the fundamental drivers of ecology and evolution. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {The green picoalga Ostreococcus is emerging as a simple plant model organism, and two species, O. lucimarinus and O. tauri, have now been sequenced and annotated manually. To evaluate the completeness of the metabolic annotation of both species, metabolic networks of O. lucimarinus and O. tauri were reconstructed from the KEGG database, thermodynamically constrained, elementally balanced, and functionally evaluated. The draft networks contained extensive gaps and, in the case of O. tauri, no biomass components could be produced due to an incomplete Calvin cycle. To find and remove gaps from the networks, an extensive reference biochemical reaction database was assembled using a stepwise approach that minimized the inclusion of microbial reactions. Gaps were then removed from both Ostreococcus networks using two existing gap-filling methodologies. In the first method, a bottom-up approach, a minimal list of reactions was added to each model to enable the production of all metabolites included in our biomass equation. In the second method, a top-down approach, all reactions in the reference database were added to the target networks and subsequently trimmed away based on the sequence alignment scores of identified orthologues. Because current gap-filling methods do not produce unique solutions, a quality metric that includes a weighting for phylogenetic distance and sequence similarity was developed to distinguish between gap-filling results automatically. The draft O. lucimarinus and O. tauri networks required the addition of 56 and 70 reactions, respectively, in order to produce the same biomass precursor metabolites that were produced by our plant reference database.},

abstract = {Daily rhythms play a key role in transcriptome regulation in plants and microalgae orchestrating responses that, among other processes, anticipate light transitions that are essential for their metabolism and development. The recent accumulation of genome-wide transcriptomic data generated under alternating light:dark periods from plants and microalgae has made possible integrative and comparative analysis that could contribute to shed light on the evolution of daily rhythms in the green lineage. In this work, RNA-seq and microarray data generated over 24 h periods in different light regimes from the eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana and the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Ostreococcus tauri have been integrated and analyzed using gene co-expression networks. This analysis revealeda reduction in the size of the daily rhythmic transcriptome from around 90% in Ostreococcus, being heavily influenced by light transitions, to around 40% in Arabidopsis, where a certain independence from light transitions can be observed. A novel Multiple Bidirectional Best Hit (MBBH) algorithm was applied to associate single genes with a family of potential orthologues from evolutionary distant species. Gene duplication, amplification and divergence of rhythmic expression profiles seems to have played a central role in the evolution of gene families in the green lineage such as Pseudo Response Regulators (PRRs), CONSTANS-Likes (COLs), and DNA-binding with One Finger (DOFs). Gene clustering and functional enrichment have been used to identify groups of genes with similar rhythmic gene expression patterns. The comparison of gene clusters between species based on potential orthologous relationships has unveiled a low to moderate level of conservation of daily rhythmic expression patterns. However, a strikingly high conservation was found for the gene clusters exhibiting their highest and/or lowest expression value during the light transitions.},

We present RAIN, a robust nonparametric method for the detection of rhythms of prespecified periods in biological data that can detect arbitrary wave forms.

Validation against independent data confirmed the quality of these results. The large expansion of the circadian mouse liver transcriptomes and proteomes reflected the prevalence of nonsymmetric wave forms and led to new conclusions about function.

abstract = {The largest whole genome sequencing (WGS) endeavour involving cancer and rare diseases was initiated in the UK in 2015 and ran for 5 years. Despite its rarity, sarcoma ranked third overall among the number of patients' samples sent for sequencing. Herein, we recount the lessons learned by a specialist sarcoma centre that recruited close to 1000 patients to the project, so that we and others may learn from our experience. WGS data was generated from 597 patients, but samples from the remaining approximately 400 patients were not sequenced. This was largely accounted for by unsuitability due to extensive necrosis, secondary to neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or being placed in formalin. The number of informative genomes produced was reduced further by a PCR amplification step. We showed that this loss of genomic data could be mitigated by sequencing whole genomes from needle core biopsies. Storage of resection specimens at 4 °C for up to 96 h overcame the challenge of freezing tissue out of hours including weekends. Removing access to formalin increased compliance to these storage arrangements. With over 70 different sarcoma subtypes described, WGS was a useful tool for refining diagnoses and identifying novel alterations. Genomes from 350 of the cohort of 597 patients were analysed in this study. Overall, diagnoses were modified for 3% of patients following review of the WGS findings. Continued refinement of the variant-calling bioinformatic pipelines is required as not all alterations were identified when validated against histology and standard of care diagnostic tests. Further research is necessary to evaluate the impact of germline mutations in patients with sarcoma, and sarcomas with evidence of hypermutation. Despite 50% of the WGS exhibiting domain 1 alterations, the number of patients with sarcoma who were eligible for clinical trials remains small, highlighting the need to revaluate clinical trial design.},

The large number of omic fields that are invented even led to the term “panomics” as a way to classify them all under one category.

Rather than a reductionist approach, systems biology uses a holistic and integrative approach to better figure out the whole process. Both qualitatively and quantitatively of biological system provide information about diseases, toxicities, therapies etc. Omics technologies, which systems biology brings, are valuable tools for comprehensive analyses. Automated DNA sequencers enabled the sequencing of genomes; microarray and mass spectrometry analysis permit global transcriptional profiling and lead to large-scale proteomic and metabolomics analysis. These high-throughput data need to be interpreted by bioinformatics. So far there has been no concrete published paper that compiles omics technologies according to PubMed database. In the present review, it was aimed to give brief description of systems biology and information on the advantages and disadvantages of omics technologies.},

abstract = {Reductionism has largely influenced the development of science, culminating in its application to molecular biology. An increasing number of novel research findings have, however, shattered this view, showing how the molecular-reductionist approach cannot entirely handle the complexity of biological systems. Within this framework, the advent of systems biology as a new and more integrative field of research is described, along with the form which has taken on the debate of reductionism versus holism. Such an issue occupies a central position in systems biology, and nonetheless it is not always clearly delineated. This partly occurs because different dimensions (ontological, epistemological, methodological) are involved, and yet the concerned ones often remain unspecified. Besides, within systems biology different streams can be distinguished depending on the degree of commitment to embrace genuine systemic principles. Some useful insights into the future development of this discipline might be gained from the tradition of complexity and self-organization. This is especially true with regards the idea of self-reference, which incorporated into the organizational scheme is able to generate autonomy as an emergent property of the biological whole. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Many research questions in fields such as personalized medicine, drug screens or systems biology depend on obtaining consistent and quantitatively accurate proteomics data from many samples. SWATH‐MS is a specific variant of data‐independent acquisition (DIA) methods and is emerging as a technology that combines deep proteome coverage capabilities with quantitative consistency and accuracy. In a SWATH‐MS measurement, all ionized peptides of a given sample that fall within a specified mass range are fragmented in a systematic and unbiased fashion using rather large precursor isolation windows. To analyse SWATH‐MS data, a strategy based on peptide‐centric scoring has been established, which typically requires prior knowledge about the chromatographic and mass spectrometric behaviour of peptides of interest in the form of spectral libraries and peptide query parameters. This tutorial provides guidelines on how to set up and plan a SWATH‐MS experiment, how to perform the mass spectrometric measurement and how to analyse SWATH‐MS data using peptide‐centric scoring. Furthermore, concepts on how to improve SWATH‐MS data acquisition, potential trade‐offs of parameter settings and alternative data analysis strategies are discussed.

abstract = {Missing values are a major issue in quantitative proteomics analysis. While many methods have been developed for imputing missing values in high-throughput proteomics data, a comparative assessment of imputation accuracy remains inconclusive, mainly because mechanisms contributing to true missing values are complex and existing evaluation methodologies are imperfect. Moreover, few studies have provided an outlook of future methodological development. We first re-evaluate the performance of eight representative methods targeting three typical missing mechanisms. These methods are compared on both simulated and masked missing values embedded within real proteomics datasets, and performance is evaluated using three quantitative measures. We then introduce fused regularization matrix factorization, a low-rank global matrix factorization framework, capable of integrating local similarity derived from additional data types. We also explore a biologically-inspired latent variable modeling strategy—convex analysis of mixtures—for missing value imputation and present preliminary experimental results. While some winners emerged from our comparative assessment, the evaluation is intrinsically imperfect because performance is evaluated indirectly on artificial missing or masked values not authentic missing values. Nevertheless, we show that our fused regularization matrix factorization provides a novel incorporation of external and local information, and the exploratory implementation of convex analysis of mixtures presents a biologically plausible new approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Romero-Campero et al. Background: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is the model organism that serves as a reference for studies in algal genomics and physiology. It is of special interest in the study of the evolution of regulatory pathways from algae to higher plants. Additionally, it has recently gained attention as a potential source for bio-fuel and bio-hydrogen production. The genome of Chlamydomonas is available, facilitating the analysis of its transcriptome by RNA-seq data. This has produced a massive amount of data that remains fragmented making necessary the application of integrative approaches based on molecular systems biology. Results: We constructed a gene co-expression network based on RNA-seq data and developed a web-based tool, ChlamyNET, for the exploration of the Chlamydomonas transcriptome. ChlamyNET exhibits a scale-free and small world topology. Applying clustering techniques, we identified nine gene clusters that capture the structure of the transcriptome under the analyzed conditions. One of the most central clusters was shown to be involved in carbon/nitrogen metabolism and signalling, whereas one of the most peripheral clusters was involved in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. The transcription factors and regulators in the Chlamydomonas genome have been identified in ChlamyNET. The biological processes potentially regulated by them as well as their putative transcription factor binding sites were determined. The putative light regulated transcription factors and regulators in the Chlamydomonas genome were analyzed in order to provide a case study on the use of ChlamyNET. Finally, we used an independent data set to cross-validate the predictive power of ChlamyNET. Conclusions: The topological properties of ChlamyNET suggest that the Chlamydomonas transcriptome posseses important characteristics related to error tolerance, vulnerability and information propagation. The central part of ChlamyNET constitutes the core of the transcriptome where most authoritative hub genes are located interconnecting key biological processes such as light response with carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Our study reveals that key elements in the regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, light response and cell cycle identified in higher plants were already established in Chlamydomonas. These conserved elements are not only limited to transcription factors, regulators and their targets, but also include the cis-regulatory elements recognized by them.},

abstract = {In cancer research, it is important to classify tissue samples in different classes (normal, tumour, tumour type, etc.). Gene selection purpose is to find the minimum number of genes that can predict sample classes with efficacy. This work is focused on the gene selection problem by introducing a new hybrid method. This new method combines a first step of gene filtering with an optimization algorithm in a second step to find the best subset of genes for the classification task. The first step uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process, in which five ranking methods are used to select the most relevant genes in the dataset. In this way, this gene filtering reduces the number of genes to manage. Regarding the second step, the gene selection can be divided into two objectives: minimizing the number of selected genes and maximizing the classification accuracy. Therefore, we have used a multi-objective optimization approach. More exactly, an Artificial Bee Colony based on Dominance (ABCD) algorithm has been proposed for this second step. Our approach has been tested with eleven real cancer datasets and the results have been compared with several multi-objective methods proposed in the scientific literature. Our results show a high accuracy in the classification task with a small subset of genes. Also, to prove the relevance of our proposal, a biological analysis has been developed on the genes selected. The conclusions of this biological analysis are positive, because the selected genes are closely linked to the cancer dataset they belong to.},

abstract = {The glnB gene from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that encodes the PII protein has been cloned by heterologous hybridization using the corresponding glnB gene from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. An ORF of 336 nucleotides appeared that potentially coded for a protein of 112 amino acid residues (M(r) 12 397). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a high identity (higher than 80%) with its cyanobacterial counterparts and a basal level of identity (close to 60%) with other PII proteins. A single mRNA of about 680 nucleotides was found under all growth conditions studied. glnB gene expression was specifically activated under nitrogen deprivation (a 10-fold increase respect to nitrogen-replete conditions). No differences in glnB mRNA levels were observed when using nitrate or ammonium as nitrogen sources. Amount of glnB mRNA decreased to undetectable levels when transferring cells to the dark, but effect was avoided by adding glucose to the culture medium. Primer extension analysis and band-shift assays indicated that expression of the glnB gene, elevated under nitrogen deprivation, might lie under the control of the nitrogen transcriptional regulator NtcA, although constitutive levels of expression were also detected from a $\sigma$ 70 -dependent Escherichia coli-like promoter.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks are an intrinsic element of life that orchestrate appropriately timed daily physiological and behavioural rhythms entrained to the solar cycle, thereby conferring increased fitness. However, it is thought that the first archaic ‘proto-clocks' evolved in ancient cyanobacteria in a marine environment, where the dominant time cues (zeitgebers) probably would have been lunar-driven and included tidal cycles. To date, non-circadian ‘marine clocks' have been described with circatidal ($\sim$12.4 h), circasemilunar ($\sim$14.8 days), and circalunar ($\sim$29.5 days) periodicity, mostly studied in accessible but temporally complex intertidal habitats. In contrast to the well-described circadian clock, their molecular machinery is poorly understood, and fundamental mechanisms remain unclear. We propose that a multi-species approach is the most apposite strategy to resolve the divergence that arose from non-circadian clockwork forged in an evolutionary environment with multiple zeitgebers. We review circatidal clock models with a focus on intertidal organisms, for which robust behavioural, physiological, or genetic underpinnings have been explicated, and discuss their relative experimental merits. Developing a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of circatidal clocks should be a priority because it will ultimately contribute to a more holistic understanding of the origins and evolution of chronobiology itself.},

It is plausible that even the first life forms adapted to the different rhythms controlled by the moon. Consistently, many marine species exhibit lunar rhythms, and also the number of documented “lunar-rhythmic” terrestrial species is increasing. Organisms follow diverse lunar geophysical/astronomical rhythms, which differ significantly in terms of period length: from hours (circalunidian and circatidal rhythms) to days (circasemilunar and circalunar cycles). Evidence for internal circatital and circalunar oscillators exists for a range of species based on past behavioral studies, but those species with well-documented behaviorally free-running lunar rhythms are not typically used for molecular studies. Thus, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely obscure: the dark side of the moon. Here we review findings that start to connect molecular pathways with moon-controlled physiology and behaviors. The present data indicate connections between metabolic/endocrine pathways and moon-controlled rhythms, as well as interactions between circadian and circatidal/circalunar rhythms. Moreover, recent high-throughput analyses provide useful leads toward pathways, as well as molecular markers. However, for each interpretation, it is important to carefully consider the, partly substantially differing, conditions used in each experimental paradigm. In the future, it will be important to use lab experiments to delineate the specific mechanisms of the different solar- and lunar-controlled rhythms, but to also start integrating them together, as life has evolved equally long under rhythms of both sun and moon.},

Although S. elongatus does not display an easily measurable overt circadian behavior, its gene expression is under circadian control; hence, a "behavior" is created by linking a cyanobacterial promoter to either the bacterial luxAB or firefly luc luciferase genes to create reporter fusions whose activity can be easily monitored by bioluminescence. Numerous vectors have been created in our lab for introducing luciferase reporter genes into the S. elongatus chromosome. A choice of methods and equipment to detect light production from the luciferase fusions provides a means for high-throughput, automated mutant screens as well as testing rhythms from two promoter fusions within the same cell culture. {\textcopyright} Humana Press Inc.},

abstract = {Biological rhythms that allow organisms to adapt to the solar cycle are generated by endogenous circadian clocks. In higher plants, many clock components have been identified and cellular rhythmicity is thought to be driven by a complex transcriptional feedback circuitry. In the small genome of the green unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri, two of the master clock genes Timing of Cab expression1 (TOC1) and Circadian Clock-Associated1 (CCA1) appear to be conserved, but others like Gigantea or Early-Flowering4 are lacking. Stably transformed luciferase reporter lines and tools for gene functional analysis were therefore developed to characterize clock gene function in this simple eukaryotic system. This approach revealed several features that are comparable to those in higher plants, including the circadian regulation of TOC1, CCA1, and the output gene Chlorophyll a/b Binding under constant light, the relative phases of TOC1/CCA1 expression under light/dark cycles, arrhythmic overexpression phenotypes under constant light, the binding of CCA1 to a conserved evening element in the TOC1 promoter, as well as the requirement of the evening element for circadian regulation of TOC1 promoter activity. Functional analysis supports TOC1 playing a central role in the clock, but repression of CCA1 had no effect on clock function in constant light, arguing against a simple TOC1 /CCA1 one-loop clock in Ostreococcus. The emergence of functional genomics in a simple green cell with a small genome may facilitate increased understanding of how complex cellular processes such as the circadian clock have evolved in plants.},

Here, we identify in Bacillus subtilis circadian rhythms sharing the canonical properties of circadian clocks: free-running period, entrainment, and temperature compensation. We show that gene expression in B. subtilis can be synchronized in 24-hour light or temperature cycles and exhibit phase-specific characteristics of entrainment. Upon release to constant dark and temperature conditions, bacterial biofilm populations have temperature-compensated free-running oscillations with a period close to 24 hours. Our work opens the field of circadian clocks in the free-living, nonphotosynthetic prokaryotes, bringing considerable potential for impact upon biomedicine, ecology, and industrial processes.},

The latter function is a central role of GI, as it involves a multitude of pathways, both dependent and independent of the gene CONSTANS(CO), as well as on the basis of interaction with miRNA.

The main maximum of sensitivity was detected 5 h after the beginning of the subjective day, the main minimum 5 h before the beginning of the subjective day. Transferring synchronized cultures to continuous light resulted in an almost instantaneous loss of rhythmicity. In contrast, after transfer to permanent darkness cells exhibited a circadian rhythm with a progressive shortening of the period for more than 5 days. These findings are in contrast to the circadian rhythm of phototaxis in Euglena, where a free-running period of 24 h was observed. Parallel measurements of negative gravitactic orientation, velocity, cell shape as well as cAMP concentration in synchronized cultures revealed a circadian rhythm of all reactions. The results are discussed with regard to the possible role of cell shape and cAMP in gravitactic orientation.},

Secondary peaks of activity were also often noted during the new moon period. This synodic rhythm was suppressed by low temperatures. Ant-lions have also been shown to possess a lunar-day activity rhythm with the peak 4 hr after moonrise. This lunar-day rhythm combines with the solar-day rhythm to produce the synodic pit-building activity rhythm. The synodic rhythm, and hence the lunar-day rhythm, was shown to be endogenous since it continued for some time both in constant light and in constant dark. Moonlight was found to act as a 'Zeitgeber', or phase-setting factor, for these endogenous rhythms. The possible functions of lunar rhythms in ant-lions are discussed, and it is suggested that the lunar-day and synodic rhythms are of no functional significance but arise as a result of chance phase setting of the light-sensitive 'solar-day clock' by the light of the moon. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

abstract = {Synaptic vesicle recycling is one of the best-studied cellular pathways. Many of the proteins involved are known, and their interactions are becoming increasingly clear. However, as for many other pathways, it is still difficult to understand synaptic vesicle recycling as a whole. While it is generally possible to point out how synaptic reactions take place, it is not always easy to understand what triggers or controls them. Also, it is often difficult to understand how the availability of the reaction partners is controlled: how the reaction partners manage to find each other in the right place, at the right time. I present here an overview of synaptic vesicle recycling, discussing the mechanisms that trigger different reactions, and those that ensure the availability of reaction partners. A central argument is that synaptic vesicles bind soluble cofactor proteins, with low affinity, and thus control their availability in the synapse, forming a buffer for cofactor proteins. The availability of cofactor proteins, in turn, regulates the different synaptic reactions. Similar mechanisms, in which one of the reaction partners buffers another, may apply to many other processes, from the biogenesis to the degradation of the synaptic vesicle.},

Circadian clocks also function in time-compensation for celestial navigation and in the measurement of day or night length for photoperiodism. Phase response curves for such clocks reported thus far exhibit close similarities; specifically, the circannual clock in Anthrenus verbasci shows striking similarity to circadian clocks in its phase response. It is suggested that diverse biological clocks share physiological properties in their phase responses irrespective of period length. Molecular and physiological mechanisms are best understood for the optic-lobe and mid-brain circadian clocks, although there is no direct evidence that these clocks are involved in rhythmic phenomena other than circadian rhythms in daily events. Circadian clocks have also been localized in peripheral tissues, and research on their role in various rhythmic phenomena has been started. Although clock genes have been identified as controllers of circadian rhythms in daily events, some of these genes have also been shown to be involved in photoperiodism and possibly in time-compensated celestial navigation.

It represents a logical step arising from the increasing insights into the circadian system and its interactions with life in urbanised societies; applying these insights to the health/disease balance at home and in the medical practice (outpatient) and clinic (inpatient). Despite its fast expansion and proliferating research efforts, circadian medicine lacks a formal framework to categorise the many observations describing interactions among the circadian system, sleep, and the health/disease balance. A good framework allows us to categorise observations and then assign them to one or more components with hypothesised interactions. Such assignments can lead to experiments that document causal (rather than correlational) relationships and move from describing observations to discovering mechanisms. This review details such a proposed formal framework for circadian medicine and will hopefully trigger discussion among our colleagues, so that the framework can be improved and expanded. As the basis of the framework for circadian medicine, we define “circadian health” and how it links to general health. We then define interactions among the circadian system, sleep, and the health/disease balance and put the framework into the context of the literature with examples from six domains of health/disease balance: fertility, cancer, immune system, mental health, cardiovascular, and metabolism.},

abstract = {Twice-a-year migrations, one in autumn and the other in spring, occur within a discrete time window with striking alterations in the behavior and physiology, as regulated by the interaction of endogenous rhythms with prevailing photoperiod. These seasonal voyages are not isolated events; rather, they are part of an overall annual itinerary and remain closely coupled to the other annual subcycles, called seasonal life history states (LHSs). The success of migration depends on appropriate timing of the initiation and termination of each LHS, for example, reproduction, molt, summer nonmigratory, preautumn migratory (fattening and weight gain), autumn migratory, winter nonmigratory (wnM), prevernal (spring) migratory (fattening and weight gain), and spring migratory LHSs. Migration-linked photoperiod-induced changes include the body fattening and weight gain, nocturnal Zugunruhe (migratory restlessness), elevated triglycerides and free fatty acids, triiodothyronine and corticosterone levels. Hypothalamic expression of the thyroid hormone-responsive dio2 and dio3, light-responsive per2, cry1, and adcyap1 and th (tyrosine hydroxylase, involved in dopamine biosynthesis) genes also show significant changes with transition from wnM to the vernal migratory LHS. Concurrent changes in the expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and its transport also occur in the liver and flight muscles, respectively. Interestingly, there are clear differences in the behavioral and physiological phenotypes, and associated molecular changes, between the autumn and vernal migrations. In this review, we discuss seasonal changes in the behavior and physiology, and present molecular insights into the development of migratory phenotypes in latitudinal avian migrants, with special reference to Palearctic-Indian migratory buntings.},

abstract = {This review considers cellular chronobiology and examines, at least in a superficial way, several classes of models and mechanisms that have been proposed for circadian rhythmicity and some of the experimental approaches that have appeared to be most productive. After a brief discussion of temporal organization and the metabolic, epigenetic, and circadian time domains, the general properties of circadian rhythms are enumerated. A survey of independent oscillations in isolated organs, tissues, and cells is followed by a review of selected circadian rhythms in eukaryotic microorganisms, with particular emphasis placed on the rhythm of cell division in the algal flagellate Euglena as a model system illustrating temporal differentiation. In the ensuing section, experimental approaches to circadian clock mechanisms are considered. The dissection of the clock by the use of chemical inhibitors is illustrated for the rhythm of bioluminescence in the marine dinoflagellate Gonyaulax and for the rhythm of photosynthetic capacity in the unicellular green alga Acetabularia. Alternatively, genetic analysis of circadian oscillators is considered in the green alga Chlamydomonas and in the bread mold Neurospora, both of which have yielded clock mutants and mutants having biochemical lesions that exhibit altered clock properties. On the basis of the evidence generated by these experimental approaches, several classes of biochemical and molecular models for circadian clocks have been proposed. These include strictly molecular models, feedback loop (network) models, transcriptional (tape‐reading) models, and membrane models; some of their key elements and predictions are discussed. Finally, a number of general unsolved problems at the cellular level are briefly mentioned: cell cycle interfaces, the evolution of circadian rhythmicity, the possibility of multiple cellular oscillators, chrono‐pharmacology and chronotherapy, and cell‐cycle clocks in development and aging.

Although the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is known to regulate a wide range of circadian behaviors, the role for intrinsic rhythmicity in other tissues is unknown. We tested whether the main olfactory bulb (OB) of mice mediates daily changes in olfaction. We found circadian rhythms in cedar oil-induced c-Fos, a protein marker of cellular excitation, in the mitral and granular layers of the OB and in the piriform cortex (PC). These oscillations persisted in constant darkness with a fourfold change in amplitude and a peak ∼4 h after the onset of daily locomotor activity. Electrolytic lesions of the SCN abolished circadian locomotor rhythms, but not odor-induced c-Fos rhythms in the OB or PC. Furthermore, removal of the OB abolished spontaneous circadian cycling of c-Fos in the PC, shortened the free-running period of locomotor rhythms, and accelerated re-entrainment after a 6 h advance and slowed re-entrainment after a 6 h delay in the light schedule. OB ablation or odorant altered the amplitude of c-Fos rhythms in the SCN and ablation of one OB abolished c-Fos rhythms in the ipsilateral PC, but not in the contralateral OB and PC. We conclude that the OB comprises a master circadian pacemaker, which enhances olfactory responsivity each night, drives rhythms in the PC, and interacts with the SCN to coordinate other daily behaviors.

abstract = {Several different environmental signals can induce asexual spore development (conidiation) and expression of developmentally regulated genes in Neurospora crassa. However, under constant conditions, where no environmental cues for conidiation are present, the endogenous circadian clock in N. crassa promotes daily rhythms in expression of known developmental genes and of conidiation. We anticipated that the same pathway of gene regulation would be followed during clock-controlled conidiation and environmental induction of conidiation and that the circadian clock would need only to control the initial developmental switch. Previous experiments showed that high-level developmental induction of the clock-controlled genes eas (ccg-2) and ccg-1 requires the developmental regulatory proteins FL and ACON-2, respectively, and normal developmental induction of fl mRNA expression requires ACON-2. We demonstrate that the circadian clock regulates rhythmic fl gene expression and that fl rhythmicity requires ACON-2. However, we find that clock regulation of eas (ccg-2) is normal in an fl mutant strain and ccg-1 expression is rhythmic in an acon-2 mutant strain. Together, these data point to the endogenous clock and the environment following separate pathways to regulate conidiation-specific gene expression.},

abstract = {Animals that inhabit mid-to high-latitude regions exhibit various adaptive behaviors, such as migration, reproduction, molting and hibernation in response to seasonal cues. These adaptive behaviors are tightly regulated by seasonal changes in photoperiod, the relative day length vs night length. Recently, the regulatory pathway of seasonal reproduction has been elucidated using quail. In birds, deep brain photoreceptors receive and transmit light information to the pars tuberalis in the pituitary gland, which induces the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Thyroid-stimulating hormone locally activates thyroid hormone via induction of type 2 deiodinase in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Thyroid hormone then induces morphological changes in the terminals of neurons that express gonadotropin-releasing hormone and facilitates gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland. In mammals, light information is received by photoreceptors in the retina and neurally transmitted to the pineal gland, where it inhibits the synthesis and secretion of melatonin, which is crucial for seasonal reproduction. Importantly, the signaling pathway downstream of light detection and signaling is fully conserved between mammals and birds. In fish, the regulatory components of seasonal reproduction are integrated, from light detection to neuroendocrine output, in a fish-specific organ called the saccus vasculosus. Various physiological processes in humans are also influenced by seasonal environmental changes. The findings discussed herein may provide clues to addressing human diseases, such as seasonal affective disorder.},

abstract = {To examine the effects of different wavelengths of light on the circadian clock, Djungarian hamsters were maintained under long photoperiod 16 h light and 8 h dark (LD 16:8) and were exposed to white, blue and red light of different irradiances for 5 weeks; one week in constant light (LL) to determine the endogenous period ($\tau$) and the activity phase (a) and 4 weeks in a LD 16:8 photoperiod to look for long-term effects on reproduction. In white and blue light the hamsters followed “Aschoff's Rule,” i.e., the higher the irradiance the longer $\tau$ (Aschoff, 1964). In red light $\tau$ remained unchanged up to an intensity of 36 mW/m2 and then increased abruptly to values of 25.2 h. The activity phase also changed during LL. Low light intensities decompressed a. With increasing light intensity a compressed which is equivalent to shortening the subjective night length. Blue light was most effective in compressing a, followed by white and red light. Some hamsters became arrhythmic after LL photoperiod, the higher the light intensity used, the more often this occurred. Melatonin and serotonin in the pineal glands were lowered in arrhythmic hamsters in the middle of their dark phase. During four weeks in LD 16:8 photoperiod the testes decreased to 80% of initial size in low light intensities (0.5 mW/m2) of white and blue light, and in all irradiances (up to 70 mW/m2) of red light tested. The results show that changes of light spectrum and intensity may be potent cues enabling Djungarian hamsters to adapt to different seasons. {\textcopyright} 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In close association with signals from the circadian clock and the photoreceptors, photoperiodic sensing constitutes also a precise way to determine the passing of the seasons and to take annual decisions such as the best time to flower or the beginning of dormancy. Photoperiodic sensing in photosynthetic organisms is ancient and two major stages in its evolution could be identified, the cyanobacterial time sensing and the evolutionary tool kit that arose in green algae and developed into the photoperiodic system of modern plants. The most recent discoveries about the evolution of the perception of light, measurement of day length and relationship with the circadian clock along the evolution of the eukaryotic green lineage will be discussed in this review.},

Viridiplantae or the green lineage is divided into two clades, Chlorophyta and Streptophyta, that in turn splits into Embryophyta or land plants and Charophyta. Charophyta are used in evolutionary studies on plant terrestralization since they are generally accepted as the extant algal species most closely related to current land plants. In this study, we have chosen the facultative terrestrial early charophyte alga Klebsormidium nitens to perform an integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis under high light in order to unveil key mechanisms involved in the early steps of plants terrestralization. We found a fast chloroplast retrograde signaling possibly mediated by reactive oxygen species and the inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (SAL1) and 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate (PAP) pathways inducing gene expression and accumulation of specific metabolites. Systems used by both Chlorophyta and Embryophyta were activated such as the xanthophyll cycle with an accumulation of zeaxanthin and protein folding and repair mechanisms constituted by NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases, thioredoxin-disulfide reductases, and peroxiredoxins. Similarly, cyclic electron flow, specifically the pathway dependent on proton gradient regulation 5, was strongly activated under high light. We detected a simultaneous co-activation of the non-photochemical quenching mechanisms based on LHC-like stress related (LHCSR) protein and the photosystem II subunit S that are specific to Chlorophyta and Embryophyta, respectively. Exclusive Embryophyta systems for the synthesis, sensing, and response to the phytohormone auxin were also activated under high light in K. nitens leading to an increase in auxin content with the concomitant accumulation of amino acids such as tryptophan, histidine, and phenylalanine.},

Studies in unicellular photosynthetic algae, such as Chlamydomonas or Euglena, have shown that the photoperiodic control of cell division is mediated through the circadian clock. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We have studied the molecular basis of light-dependent control of cell division in the unicellular green alga Ostreococcus. We found that cell division obeys a circadian oscillator in Ostreococcus. We provide evidence suggesting that the clock may, at least in part, regulate directly cell division independently of the metabolism. Combined microarray and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the main core cell cycle gene expression revealed an extensive transcriptional regulation of cell division by the photoperiod in Ostreococcus. Finally, transcription of the main core cell cycle genes, including cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, was shown to be under circadian control in Ostreococcus, suggesting that these genes are potential targets of the circadian clock in the control of cell division. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

abstract = {Although the decision to proceed through cell division depends largely on the metabolic status or the size of the cell, the timing of cell division is often set by internal clocks such as the circadian clock. Light is a major cue for circadian clock entrainment, and for photosynthetic organisms it is also the main source of energy supporting cell growth prior to cell division. Little is known about how light signals are integrated in the control of S phase entry. Here, we present an integrated study of light-dependent regulation of cell division in the marine green alga Ostreococcus. During early G1, the main genes of cell division were transcribed independently of the amount of light, and the timing of S phase did not occur prior to 6 hours after dawn. In contrast S phase commitment and the translation of a G1 A-type cyclin were dependent on the amount of light in a cAMP-dependent manner. CyclinA was shown to interact with the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein during S phase. Down-regulating Rb bypassed the requirement for CyclinA and cAMP without altering the timing of S phase. Overexpression of CyclinA overrode the cAMP-dependent control of S phase entry and led to early cell division. Therefore, the Rb pathway appears to integrate light signals in the control of S phase entry in Ostreococcus, though differential transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations of a G1 A-type cyclin. Furthermore, commitment to S phase depends on a cAMP pathway, which regulates the synthesis of CyclinA. We discuss the relative involvements of the metabolic and time/clock signals in the photoperiodic control of cell division. {\textcopyright} 2010 Moulager et al.},

abstract = {Background: The green picoalga Ostreococcus tauri (Prasinophyceae), which has been described as the smallest free-living eukaryotic organism, has minimal cellular ultra-structure and a very small genome. In recent years, O. tauri has emerged as a novel model organism for systems biology approaches that combine functional genomics and mathematical modeling, with a strong emphasis on light regulated processes and circadian clock. These approaches were made possible through the implementation of a minimal molecular toolbox for gene functional analysis including overexpression and knockdown strategies. We have previously shown that the promoter of the High Affinity Phosphate Transporter (HAPT) gene drives the expression of a luciferase reporter at high and constitutive levels under constant light. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report, using a luciferase reporter construct, that the HAPT promoter can be finely and reversibly tuned by modulating the level and nature of phosphate in culture medium. This HAPT regulation was additionally used to analyze the circadian clock gene Time of Cab expression 1 (TOC1). The phenotype of a TOC1ox/CCA1:Luc line was reverted from arrhythmic to rhythmic simply by adding phosphate to the culture medium. Furthermore, since the time of phosphate injection had no effect on the phase of CCA1:Luc expression, this study suggests further that TOC1 is a central clock gene in Ostreococcus. Conclusions/Perspectives: We have developed a phosphate-regulated expression system that allows fine gene function analysis in Ostreococcus. Recently, there has been a growing interest in microalgae as cell factories. This non-toxic phosphate-regulated system may prove useful in tuning protein expression levels quantitatively and temporally for biotechnological applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Djouani-Tahri et al.},

abstract = {Background: Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) is one of few proteins known to affect cellular timekeeping across metazoans, and the naturally occurring CK1tau mutation shortens circadian period in mammals. Functional conservation of a timekeeping function for CK1 in the green lineage was recently identified in the green marine unicell Ostreococcus tauri, in spite of the absence of CK1's transcriptional targets known from other species. The short-period phenotype of CK1tau mutant in mammals depends specifically on increased CK1 activity against PERIOD proteins. To understand how CK1 acts differently upon the algal clock, we analysed the cellular and proteomic effects of CK1tau overexpression in O. tauri. Results: Overexpression of the CK1tau in O. tauri induces period lengthening identical to overexpression of wild-type CK1, in addition to resistance to CK1 inhibitor IC261. Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry of CK1tau overexpressing algae revealed a total of 58 unique phospho-sites that are differentially responsive to CK1tau. Combined with CK1 phosphorylation site prediction tools and previously published wild-type CK1-responsive peptides, this study results in a highly stringent list of upregulated phospho-sites, derived from proteins containing ankyrin repeats, kinase proteins, and phosphoinositide-binding proteins. Conclusions: The identical phenotype for overexpression of wild-type CK1 and CK1tau is in line with the absence of critical targets for rodent CK1tau in O. tauri. Proteomic analyses reveal that two thirds of previously reported CK1 overexpression-responsive phospho-sites are shared with CK1tau. These results indicate that the two alleles are functionally indiscriminate in O. tauri, and verify the identified cellular CK1 target proteins in a minimal circadian model organism. {\textcopyright} 2013 van Ooijen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks in eukaryotes involve both transcriptional-translational feedback loops, post-translational regulation, and metabolic, non-transcriptional oscillations. We recently identified the involvement of circadian oscillations in the intracellular concentrations of magnesium ions ([Mg 2+ ]i) that were conserved in three eukaryotic kingdoms. [Mg 2+ ]i in turn contributes to transcriptional clock properties of period and amplitude, and can function as a zeitgeber to define phase. However, the mechanism-or mechanisms-responsible for the generation of [Mg 2+ ]i oscillations, and whether these are functionally conserved across taxonomic groups, remain elusive. We employed the cellular clock model Ostreococcus tauri to provide a first study of an MgtE domaincontaining protein in the green lineage. OtMgtE shares homology with the mammalian SLC41A1 magnesium/sodium antiporter, which has previously been implicated in maintaining clock period. Using genetic overexpression, we found that OtMgtE contributes to both timekeeping and daily changes in [Mg 2+ ]i. However, pharmacological experiments and protein sequence analyses indicated that critical differences exist between OtMgtE and either the ancestral MgtE channel or the mammalian SLC41 antiporters. We concluded that even though MgtE domain-containing proteins are only distantly related, these proteins retain a shared role in contributing to cellular timekeeping and the regulation of [Mg 2+ ]i.},

abstract = {Background: The current knowledge of eukaryote signalling originates from phenotypically diverse organisms. There is a pressing need to identify conserved signalling components among eukaryotes, which will lead to the transfer of knowledge across kingdoms. Two useful properties of a eukaryote model for signalling are (1) reduced signalling complexity, and (2) conservation of signalling components. The alga Ostreococcus tauri is described as the smallest free-living eukaryote. With less than 8,000 genes, it represents a highly constrained genomic palette. Results: Our survey revealed 133 protein kinases and 34 protein phosphatases (1.7% and 0.4% of the proteome). We conducted phosphoproteomic experiments and constructed domain structures and phylogenies for the catalytic protein-kinases. For each of the major kinases families we review the completeness and divergence of O. tauri representatives in comparison to the well-studied kinomes of the laboratory models Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and of Homo sapiens. Many kinase clades in O. tauri were reduced to a single member, in preference to the loss of family diversity, whereas TKL and ABC1 clades were expanded. We also identified kinases that have been lost in A. thaliana but retained in O. tauri. For three, contrasting eukaryotic pathways - TOR, MAPK, and the circadian clock - we established the subset of conserved components and demonstrate conserved sites of substrate phosphorylation and kinase motifs. Conclusions: We conclude that O. tauri satisfies our two central requirements. Several of its kinases are more closely related to H. sapiens orthologs than S. cerevisiae is to H. sapiens. The greatly reduced kinome of O. tauri is therefore a suitable model for signalling in free-living eukaryotes.},

Several complete genomes of both these viruses and their marine algal hosts are now available and have been used to show the pervasive presence of these species in microbial metagenomes. We have analyzed the life cycle of Ostreococcus tauri virus 5 (OtV5), a lytic virus, using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) from 12 time points of healthy or infected Ostreococcus tauri cells over a day/night cycle in culture. In the day, viral gene transcription remained low while host nitrogen metabolism gene transcription was initially strongly repressed for two successive time points before being induced for 8 h, but during the night, viral transcription increased steeply while host nitrogen metabolism genes were repressed and many host functions that are normally reduced in the dark appeared to be compensated either by genes expressed from the virus or by increased expression of a subset of 4.4% of the host's genes. Some host cells underwent lysis progressively during the night, but a larger proportion were lysed the following morning. Our data suggest that the life cycles of algal viruses mirror the diurnal rhythms of their hosts.  IMPORTANCE Prasinoviruses are common in marine environments, and although several complete genomes of these viruses and their hosts have been characterized, little is known about their life cycles. Here we analyze in detail the transcriptional changes occurring over a 27-h-long experiment in a natural diurnal rhythm, in which the growth of host cells is to some extent synchronized, so that host DNA replication occurs late in the day or early in the night and cell division occurs during the night. Surprisingly, viral transcription remains quiescent over the daytime, when the most energy (from light) is available, but during the night viral transcription activates, accompanied by expression of a few host genes that are probably required by the virus. Although our experiment was accomplished in the lab, cyclical changes have been documented in host transcription in the ocean. Our observations may thus be relevant for eukaryotic phytoplankton in natural environments. },

abstract = {Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, and coordinate numerous aspects of behaviour, physiology and metabolism, from sleep/wake cycles in mammals to growth and photosynthesis in plants. This daily timekeeping is thought to be driven by transcriptionaltranslational feedback loops, whereby rhythmic expression of clock- gene products regulates the expression of associated genes in approximately 24-hour cycles. The specific transcriptional components differ between phylogenetic kingdoms. The unicellular pico-eukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri possesses a naturally minimized clock, which includes many features that are shared with plants, such as a central negative feedback loop that involves the morning-expressed CCA1 and evening-expressed TOC1 genes. Given that recent observations in animals and plants have revealed prominent post-translational contributions to timekeeping, a reappraisal of the transcriptional contribution to oscillator function is overdue. Here we show that non-transcriptional mechanisms are sufficient to sustain circadian timekeeping in the eukaryotic lineage, although they normally function in conjunction with transcriptional components. We identify oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins as a transcription-independent rhythmic biomarker, which is also rhythmic in mammals. Moreover we show that pharmacological modulators of the mammalian clock mechanism have the same effects on rhythms in Ostreococcus. Post-translational mechanisms, and at least one rhythmic marker, seem to be better conserved than transcriptional clock regulators. It is plausible that the oldest oscillator components are non-transcriptional in nature, as in cyanobacteria, and are conserved across kingdoms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Background: The storage of photosynthetic carbohydrate products such as starch is subject to complex regulation, effected at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. The relevant genes in plants show pronounced daily regulation. Their temporal RNA expression profiles, however, do not predict the dynamics of metabolite levels, due to the divergence of enzyme activity from the RNA profiles.Unicellular phytoplankton retains the complexity of plant carbohydrate metabolism, and recent transcriptomic profiling suggests a major input of transcriptional regulation.Results: We used a quasi-steady-state, constraint-based modelling approach to infer the dynamics of starch content during the 12 h light/12 h dark cycle in the model alga Ostreococcus tauri. Measured RNA expression datasets from microarray analysis were integrated with a detailed stoichiometric reconstruction of starch metabolism in O. tauri in order to predict the optimal flux distribution and the dynamics of the starch content in the light/dark cycle. The predicted starch profile was validated by experimental data over the 24 h cycle. The main genetic regulatory targets within the pathway were predicted by in silico analysis.Conclusions: A single-reaction description of starch production is not able to account for the observed variability of diurnal activity profiles of starch-related enzymes. We developed a detailed reaction model of starch metabolism, which, to our knowledge, is the first attempt to describe this polysaccharide polymerization while preserving the mass balance relationships. Our model and method demonstrate the utility of a quasi-steady-state approach for inferring dynamic metabolic information in O. tauri directly from time-series gene expression data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Sorokina et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Picoeukaryotes represent an important, yet poorly characterized component of marine phytoplankton. The recent genome availability for two species of Ostreococcus and Micromonas has led to the emergence of picophytoplankton comparative genomics. Sequencing has revealed many unexpected features about genome structure and led to several hypotheses on Ostreococcus biology and physiology. Despite the accumulation of genomic data, little is known about gene expression in eukaryotic picophytoplankton.Results: We have conducted a genome-wide analysis of gene expression in Ostreococcus tauri cells exposed to light/dark cycles (L/D). A Bayesian Fourier Clustering method was implemented to cluster rhythmic genes according to their expression waveform. In a single L/D condition nearly all expressed genes displayed rhythmic patterns of expression. Clusters of genes were associated with the main biological processes such as transcription in the nucleus and the organelles, photosynthesis, DNA replication and mitosis.Conclusions: Light/Dark time-dependent transcription of the genes involved in the main steps leading to protein synthesis (transcription basic machinery, ribosome biogenesis, translation and aminoacid synthesis) was observed, to an unprecedented extent in eukaryotes, suggesting a major input of transcriptional regulations in Ostreococcus. We propose that the diurnal co-regulation of genes involved in photoprotection, defence against oxidative stress and DNA repair might be an efficient mechanism, which protects cells against photo-damage thereby, contributing to the ability of O. tauri to grow under a wide range of light intensities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Monnier et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous on earth from cyanobacteria to land plants and animals. Circadian clocks are synchronized to the day/night cycle by environmental factors such as light and temperature. In eukaryotes, clocks rely on complex gene regulatory networks involving transcriptional regulation but also post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations. In multicellular organisms clocks are found at multiple levels from cells to organs and whole organisms, making the study of clock mechanisms more complex. In recent years the picoalga Ostreococcus has emerged as a new circadian model organism thanks to its reduced gene redundancy and its minimalist cellular organization. A simplified version of the "green" plant clock, involving the master clock genes TOC1 and CCA1, has been revealed when the functional genomics and mathematical model approaches were combined.Specific photoreceptors such as a blue light sensing LOV histidine kinase mediate light input to the Ostreococcus clock. Non-transcriptional redox rhythms have also been identified recently in Ostreococcus and human red blood cells. This review highlights the progress made recently in the understanding of circadian clock architecture and function in Ostreococcus in the context of the marine environment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Planktonic marine microbes live in dynamic habitats that demand rapid sensing and response to periodic as well as stochastic environmental change. The kinetics, regularity, and specificity of microbial responses in situ, however, are not well-described. We report here simultaneous multitaxon genome-wide transcriptome profiling in a naturally occurring picoplankton community. An in situ robotic sampler using a Lagrangian sampling strategy enabled continuous tracking and repeated sampling of coherent microbial populations over 2 d. Subsequent RNA sequencing analyses yielded genome-wide transcriptome profiles of eukaryotic (Ostreococcus) and bacterial (Synechococcus) photosynthetic picoplankton as well as proteorhodopsin-containing heterotrophs, including Pelagibacter, SAR86-cluster Gammaproteobacteria, and marine Euryarchaea. The photosynthetic picoplankton exhibited strong diel rhythms over thousands of gene transcripts thatwere remarkably consistentwith diel cycling observed in laboratory pure cultures. In contrast, the heterotrophs did not cycle diurnally. Instead, heterotrophic picoplankton populations exhibited cross-species synchronous, tightly regulated, temporally variable patterns of gene expression for many genes, particularly those genes associated with growth and nutrient acquisition. This multitaxon, population-wide gene regulation seemed to reflect sporadic, short-term, reversible responses to high-frequency environmental variability. Although the timing of the environmental responses among different heterotrophic species seemed synchronous, the specific metabolic genes that were expressed varied from taxon to taxon. In aggregate, these results provide insights into the kinetics, diversity, and functional patterns of microbial community response to environmental change. Our results also suggest ameans by which complex multispecies metabolic processes could be coordinated, facilitating the regulation of matter and energy processing in a dynamically changing environment.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks were, until recently, seen as a consequence of rhythmic transcription of clock components, directed by transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFLs). Oscillations of protein modification were then discovered in cyanobacteria [1, 2]. Canonical posttranslational signaling processes have known importance for clocks across taxa [3-11]. More recently, evidence from the unicellular eukaryote Ostreococcus tauri revealed a transcription-independent, rhythmic protein modification [12] shared in anucleate human cells [13]. In this study, the Ostreococcus system reveals a central role for targeted protein degradation in the mechanism of circadian timing. The Ostreococcus clockwork contains a TTFL involving the morning-expressed CCA1 and evening-expressed TOC1 proteins [14]. Cellular CCA1 and TOC1 protein content and degradation rates are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using luciferase reporter fusion proteins. CCA1 protein degradation rates, measured in high time resolution, feature a sharp clock-regulated peak under constant conditions. TOC1 degradation peaks in response to darkness. Targeted protein degradation, unlike transcription and translation, is shown to be essential to sustain TTFL rhythmicity throughout the circadian cycle. Although proteasomal degradation is not necessary for sustained posttranslational oscillations in transcriptionally inactive cells, TTFL and posttranslational oscillators are normally coupled, and proteasome function is crucial to sustain both. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The cellular landscape changes dramatically over the course of a 24 h day. The proteome responds directly to daily environmental cycles and is additionally regulated by the circadian clock. To quantify the relative contribution of diurnal versus circadian regulation, we mapped proteome dynamics under light:dark cycles compared with constant light. Using Ostreococcus tauri, a prototypical eukaryotic cell, we achieved 85% coverage, which allowed an unprecedented insight into the identity of proteins that facilitate rhythmic cellular functions. The overlap between diurnally- and circadian-regulated proteins was modest and these proteins exhibited different phases of oscillation between the two conditions. Transcript oscillations were generally poorly predictive of protein oscillations, in which a far lower relative amplitude was observed. We observed coordination between the rhythmic regulation of organelle-encoded proteins with the nuclear-encoded proteins that are targeted to organelles. Rhythmic transmembrane proteins showed a different phase distribution compared with rhythmic soluble proteins, indicating the existence of a circadian regulatory process specific to the biogenesis and/or degradation of membrane proteins. Our observations argue that the cellular spatiotemporal proteome is shaped by a complex interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory factors through rhythmic regulation at the transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels.},

abstract = {The circadian clock orchestrates an organism's endogenous processes with environmental 24 h cycles. Redox homeostasis and the circadian clock regulate one another to negate the potential effects of our planet's light/dark cycle on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and attain homeostasis. Selenoproteins are an important class of redox-related enzymes that have a selenocys-teine residue in the active site. This study reports functional understanding of how environmental and endogenous circadian rhythms integrate to shape the selenoproteome in a model eukaryotic cell. We mined quantitative proteomic data for the 24 selenoproteins of the picoeukaryote Ostreococcus tauri across time series, under environmentally rhythmic entrained conditions of light/dark (LD) cycles, compared to constant circadian conditions of constant light (LL). We found an overrepresentation of selenoproteins among rhythmic proteins under LL, but an underrepresentation under LD conditions. Rhythmic selenoproteins under LL that reach peak abundance later in the day showed a greater relative amplitude of oscillations than those that peak early in the day. Under LD, amplitude did not correlate with peak phase; however, we identified high-amplitude selenium uptake rhythms under LD but not LL conditions. Selenium deprivation induced strong qualitative defects in clock gene expression under LD but not LL conditions. Overall, the clear conclusion is that the circadian and environmental cycles exert differential effects on the selenoproteome, and that the combination of the two enables homeostasis. Selenoproteins may therefore play an important role in the cellular response to reactive oxygen species that form as a consequence of the transitions between light and dark.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks govern temporal programs in the green lineage (Chloroplastida) as they do in other photosynthetic pro- and eukaryotes, bacteria, fungi, animals, and humans. Their physiological properties, including entrainment, phase responses, and temperature compensation, are well conserved. The involvement of transcriptional/translational feedback loops in the oscillatory machinery and reversible phosphorylation events are also maintained. Circadian clocks control a large variety of output rhythms in green algae and terrestrial plants, adjusting their metabolism and behavior to the day-night cycle. The angiosperm Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) represents a well-studied circadian clock model. Several molecular components of its oscillatory machinery are conserved in other Chloroplastida, but their functions may differ. Conserved clock components include at least one member of the CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1/REVEILLE and one of the PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR family. The Arabidopsis evening complex members EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3), ELF4, and LUX ARRHYTHMO are found in the moss Physcomitrium patens and in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. In the flagellate chlorophyte alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, only homologs of ELF4 and LUX (named RHYTHM OF CHLOROPLAST ROC75) are present. Temporal ROC75 expression in C. reinhardtii is opposite to that of the angiosperm LUX, suggesting different clock mechanisms. In the picoalga Ostreococcus tauri, both ELF genes are missing, suggesting that it has a progenitor circadian “green” clock. Clock-relevant photoreceptors and thermosensors vary within the green lineage, except for the CRYPTOCHROMEs, whose variety and functions may differ. More genetically tractable models of Chloroplastida are needed to draw final conclusions about the gradual evolution of circadian clocks within the green lineage.},

abstract = {Most organisms anticipate daily environmental variations and orchestrate cellular functions thanks to a circadian clock which entrains robustly to the day/night cycle, despite fluctuations in light intensity due to weather or seasonal variations. Marine organisms are also subjected to fluctuations in light spectral composition as their depth varies, due to differential absorption of different wavelengths by sea water. Studying how light input pathways contribute to circadian clock robustness is therefore important. Ostreococcus tauri, a unicellular picoplanktonic marine green alga with low genomic complexity and simple cellular organization, has become a promising model organism for systems biology. Functional and modeling approaches have shown that a core circadian oscillator based on orthologs of Arabidopsis TOC1 and CCA1 clock genes accounts for most experimental data acquired under a wide range of conditions. Some evidence points at putative light input pathway(s) consisting of a two-component signaling system (TCS) controlled by the only two histidine kinases (HK) of O. tauri. LOV-HK is a blue light photoreceptor under circadian control, that is required for circadian clock function. An involvement of Rhodopsin-HK (Rhod-HK) is also conceivable since rhodopsin photoreceptors mediate blue to green light input in animal circadian clocks. Here, we probe the role of LOV-HK and Rhod-HK in mediating light input to the TOC1-CCA1 oscillator using a mathematical model incorporating the TCS hypothesis. This model agrees with clock gene expression time series representative of multiple environmental conditions in blue or green light, characterizing entrainment by light/dark cycles, free-running in constant light, and resetting. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that both blue and green light can reset O. tauri circadian clock. Moreover, our mathematical analysis suggests that Rhod-HK is a blue-green light receptor and drives the clock together with LOV-HK.},

abstract = {Rhythmic behavior is essential for plants; for example, daily (circadian) rhythms control photosynthesis and seasonal rhythms regulate their life cycle. The core of the circadian clock is a genetic network that coordinates the expression of specific clock genes in a circadian rhythm reflecting the 24-h day/night cycle. Circadian clocks exhibit stochastic noise due to the low copy numbers of clock genes and the consequent cell-to-cell variation: this intrinsic noise plays a major role in circadian clocks by inducing more robust oscillatory behavior. Another source of noise is the environment, which causes variation in temperature and light intensity: this extrinsic noise is part of the requirement for the structural complexity of clock networks. Advances in experimental techniques now permit single-cell measurements and the development of single-cell models. Here we present some modeling studies showing the importance of considering both types of noise in understanding how plants adapt to regular and irregular light variations. Stochastic models have proven useful for understanding the effect of regular variations. By contrast, the impact of irregular variations and the interaction of different noise sources are less well studied.},

The interlocking feedback loop mechanism of the clock is conserved across species; however, the number of loops varies. Mathematical and computational analyses have suggested that loop complexity affects the overall flexibility of the oscillator, including its responses to entrainment signals. We used a discriminating experimental assay, at the transition between different photoperiods, in order to test this proposal in a minimal circadian network (in Ostreococcus tauri) and a more complex network (in Arabidopsis thaliana). Transcriptional and translational reporters in O. tauri primarily tracked dawn or dusk, whereas in A. thaliana, a wider range of responses were observed, consistent with its more flexible clock. Model analysis supported the requirement for this diversity of responses among the components of the more complex network. However, these and earlier data showed that the O. tauri network retains surprising flexibility, despite its simple circuit. We found that models constructed from experimental data can show flexibility either from multiple loops and/or from multiple light inputs. Our results suggest that O. tauri has adopted the latter strategy, possibly as a consequence of genomic reduction. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors. New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks are biological timekeepers that allow living cells to time their activity in anticipation of predictable environmental changes. Detailed understanding of the circadian network of higher plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, is hampered by the high number of partially redundant genes. However, the picoeukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri, which was recently shown to possess a small number of non-redundant clock genes, presents an attractive alternative target for detailed modelling of circadian clocks in the green lineage. Based on extensive time-series data from in vivo reporter gene assays, we developed a model of the Ostreococcus clock as a feedback loop between the genes TOC1 and CCA1. The model reproduces the dynamics of the transcriptional and translational reporters over a range of photoperiods. Surprisingly, the model is also able to predict the transient behaviour of the clock when the light conditions are altered. Despite the apparent simplicity of the clock circuit, it displays considerable complexity in its response to changing light conditions. Systematic screening of the effects of altered day length revealed a complex relationship between phase and photoperiod, which is also captured by the model. The complex light response is shown to stem from circadian gating of light-dependent mechanisms. This study provides insights into the contributions of light inputs to the Ostreococcus clock. The model suggests that a high number of light-dependent reactions are important for flexible timing in a circadian clock with only one feedback loop. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The development of systemic approaches in biology has put emphasis on identifying genetic modules whose behavior can be modeled accurately so as to gain insight into their structure and function. However, most gene circuits in a cell are under control of external signals and thus, quantitative agreement between experimental data and a mathematical model is difficult. Circadian biology has been one notable exception: quantitative models of the internal clock that orchestrates biological processes over the 24-hour diurnal cycle have been constructed for a few organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants and mammals. In most cases, a complex architecture with interlocked feedback loops has been evidenced. Here we present the first modeling results for the circadian clock of the green unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri. Two plant-like clock genes have been shown to play a central role in the Ostreococcus clock. We find that their expression time profiles can be accurately reproduced by a minimal model of a two-gene transcriptional feedback loop. Remarkably, best adjustment of data recorded under light/dark alternation is obtained when assuming that the oscillator is not coupled to the diurnal cycle. This suggests that coupling to light is confined to specific time intervals and has no dynamical effect when the oscillator is entrained by the diurnal cycle. This intringuing property may reflect a strategy to minimize the impact of fluctuations in daylight intensity on the core circadian oscillator, a type of perturbation that has been rarely considered when assessing the robustness of circadian clocks. {\textcopyright} 2010 Thommen et al.},
